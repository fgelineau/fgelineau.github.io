    <h1>Research</h1>
  
    <p>
      My main research interests are in epistemology, with a focus on epistemic normativity and value.
      I am especially interested in how our understanding of the value of truth (in what sense is truth
      valuable?) interacts with our conceptions of the norms we ought to follow when forming and revising
      our beliefs (what are the correct epistemic norms?). These are the main questions that drive my
      dissertation. Often, the two questions are treated separately, under the tacit assumption that how
      we answer one should have little bearing on how we answer the other. In my dissertation, I challenge
      this assumption. I investigate the interplay between conceptions of value in epistemology and the
      conceptions of norms that should govern our belief-formation and belief-revision processes, and show
      how adopting one significantly constrains the other. This, I argue, has important consequences for
      several live debates in epistemology.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I am currently working on developing an account of epistemic normativity that combines these two
      key elements: on the one hand, a plausible account of the value of truth, one which
      accounts for the authority of epistemic norms and is shaped by the network of normative commitments in which agents are situated; on the other hand, an adequate conception of epistemic
      norms which is shaped by, and compatible with, this account of the value of truth.
